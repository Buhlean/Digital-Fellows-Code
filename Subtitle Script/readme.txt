This tool allows the extraction of subtitles from a youtube video. 


STEP 1:
Open the program, paste in the full URL:

www.youtube.com/watch?v=id_id_id_id

or the shortended URL:

youtu.be/id_id_id_id

or the ID itself.

It defaults to saving them in the /User/Downloads folder, 
but you can change that in the app.


STEP 2:
You can just click Extract and hope that german and/or english is available 
or
you can ask YouTube via the big button to give you a list of every transcript for that video and choose freely amongst those.


Formating the output:
Choose between 
- Text: only the text as one big blob
- JSON, which is ordered and machine-readable
- Cues, which has all the information in a textfile, including timings
