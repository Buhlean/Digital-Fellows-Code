This tool allows the extraction of german subtitles from a youtube video. 
Open the program, paste in the full URL:

www.youtube.com/watch?v=id_id_id_id

or the shortended URL:

youtu.be/id_id_id_id

or the ID itself.

It defaults to saving them in the /User/Downloads folder, 
but you can change that in the app.
